# Short

This tool is intended to provide simple url shorting and link aggregation functionality.
Users should be able to create short links for example to generate smaller QR codes with the builtin QR code generator.

The admin panel is a PWA for easy access and management of the links even on mobile devices.

It is powered by nextjs and postgres.  
Authentication is outsourced via OAuth2.
